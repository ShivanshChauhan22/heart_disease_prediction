**Overview** :
This project is focused on predicting the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset that includes various health metrics, and it aims to provide an accurate assessment of a patient's risk level.

**Features** :

**Data Preprocessing** : The dataset undergoes thorough preprocessing, including handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection to improve model accuracy.
Model Training: Multiple machine learning algorithms are implemented and compared to determine the most effective model for predicting heart disease.

**Evaluation Metrics** : The project includes detailed evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

User-Friendly Interface : A simple and intuitive user interface allows users to input their health data and receive a prediction about their heart disease risk.

**Technologies Used** : 

**Python** : The core programming language used for data processing and model implementation.

**Pandas & NumPy** : For data manipulation and numerical computations.

**Scikit-Learn** : The primary library used for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

**Matplotlib & Seaborn** : For data visualization and plotting of results.

**Usage** :
To use the prediction model, input the relevant health data into the interface, and the model will provide a prediction on whether there is a risk of heart disease.

**Contributing** :
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements, additional features, or bug fixes, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
